# My i3 Configuration

# i3 + Polybar

I decided to living with i3 because is really simple to customize and is really fast. The default bar is pretty ugly, for this reason i switch to the polybar that is more customizable. For the Program Launcher i prefer to use Rofi instead of dmenu ( that is powerfull enought) to obtain a more flexible experience.

# My Custom Chnaged Keybindings

The MODKEY is set to the Super key (aka the defualt Windows key on every Keyboard). I try to set the keybinding to reach them quickly.

| Keybinding | Action |
| :--- | :--- |
| `MODKEY + RETURN` | opens my terminal (gnome-terminal is the defualt terminal that i currently) |
| `MODKEY + SHIFT + RETURN` | opens my file manager (for the moment i use VIFM) |
| `MODKEY + d` | opens the run launcher (in my case rofi is my default run launcher) |
| `MODKEY + q` | closes the focused window |
| `MODKEY + SHIFT + r` | restarts i3 |
| `MODKEY + SHIFT + e` | quits i3 |
| `MODKEY + 1-9` | switch focus of the workspace (1-10) |
| `MODKEY + SHIFT + 1-9` | send focused window to a specific workspace (1-10) |
