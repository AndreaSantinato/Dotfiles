# Picom Compositor

I'm current using a fork of the official Picom Compositor. This Fork allow me to have round corners and awesome fade animation on open and closing windows

# What i need to do for installing this compositor?

The only thing to do is downloading it from the AUR and cloning the official GitHub repository for the Config Sample.

```
yay -S picom-jonaburg-git. 
git clone https://github.com/jonaburg/picom
cd picom/
mv picom.sample.conf ~/.config/picom/picom.conf
```
