# Awesome WM

Awesome is a powerfull and most configurable Window Manager i have ever discover, is written interaly in Lua and this language allow you to extend the wm feature without any limitation. After over 6 months using Qtile i decide to change again and with the suggestion of DistroTube i discovered this fantastic WM and decide to jump in.
Unlike Python, Lua was totally different but it wasn't too hard to understand. For now i'm using a mixed config made 50% from me and 50% based on DT config.

# What i love about Awesome
What i love about Awesome is the extremily advanced customizatrion thant i can obtain with it. Absolutly No Limit!

# My Custom Changed Keybindings

The MODKEY is set to the Super key (aka the defualt Windows key on every Keyboard). I try to set the keybinding to reach them quickly.

| Keybinding | Action |
| :--- | :--- |
| `MODKEY + RETURN` | Opens my terminal (gnome-terminal is the defualt terminal that i currently) |
| `MODKEY + SHIFT + RETURN` | opens the run launcher (in my case rofi is my default run launcher) |
| `MODKEY + TAB` | Toggle Through Layouts |
| `MODKEY + q` | Closes the focused window |
| `MODKEY + CTRL + l` | Execute the i3lock (i use i3lock-fancy, a fork of i3lock) |
| `MODKEY + SHIFT + r` | Restarts Awesome Config |
| `MODKEY + SHIFT + q` | Quits Awesome |
| `MODKEY + SHIFT + e` | Open the script power-menu.sh |
| `MODKEY + ALT + f` | Open my file manager (for the moment i use vifm) |
| `MODKEY + 1-9` | switch focus of the workspace (1-10) |
| `MODKEY + SHIFT + 1-9` | send focused window to a specific workspace (1-10) |
